# CSV-Duplicate-Email-Remover
CSV Duplicate Email Remover can remove any duplicates in a CSV of any type, and return the resulting CSV and removed values in both a CSV and a table.

How to Use:
			
When running CSVDuplicateEmailRemover, you will be prompted to enter in a CSV (with standard layout "ttf"),
a series of 3 letters in the form of "t" or "f" (for true and false) to create a custom layouts,
or a single "f" to be able to input a .CSV file.

If you are trying to copy and paste a list-style CSV file (one seperated with line breaks instead of commas),
go to https://www.gillmeister-software.com/online-tools/text/remove-line-breaks.aspx and paste in the list-style CSV.
Then replace all line breaks with commas "," which you can then copy and paste as normal.

A custom layout has the option to turn on and off Show Input CSV, Show Removed Values, and Show in Table Format.
To do this, enter in three consecutive letters, with no spaces between, of either t or f (for true and false).
The default layout that appears when directly entering in a CSV is "ttf".

When entering in "f", a file explorer will open. The default directory is set to downloads.
In order to sort by most recent, click once on the icon "Details" in the top right, which has 2 squares and 2 lines.
Then click the "Modified" tab twice, until the arror points downwards, indicating a sort by most recent.
